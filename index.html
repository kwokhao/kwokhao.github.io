<p>We propose a quantitative spatial model featuring heterogeneous worker groups
and their travel to consume non-tradable goods and services. We consider the
opening of the Downtown Line (DTL) in Singapore, which connected regions where
high-income households have residential amenities to where non-traded sectors
are productive. Leveraging transit farecard data, we show that high-income
workers saw large welfare gains but low-income workers gained little. Everyone
enjoyed improved access to consumption opportunities, but low-income jobs in
non-tradables moved to less attractive workplaces. Abstracting from consumption
travel understates the disparate impact across worker groups three-fold.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Consider firms that operate platforms matching buyers and sellers while selling
goods themselves. By guiding consumers towards their own products through
algorithmic recommendations, these firms could influence market outcomes - a
regulatory concern. To investigate, we combine novel data about sales and
recommendations on Amazon with a structural model that captures seller entry.
Recommendations are highly price-elastic (-20), and many consumers (34%) only
consider recommended offers. Hence, algorithmic recommendations raise the demand
elasticity (from -8 to -11), intensify price competition, and increase the
purchase rate. However, increased competition reduces entry (but the missing
merchants are the least efficient). Focusing on self-preferencing:
recommendations favor Amazon (equivalent to a 6% price discount), but this skew
does not act as a barrier to entry or otherwise harm consumers. Indeed, since
consumers prefer Amazon’s offers, &ldquo;self-preferencing&rdquo; slightly raises consumer
surplus by $9 per product per month (assuming Amazon’s prices remain constant.)</p>

</summary>
<blockquote>
<p>We consider the design of a large-scale public housing program where consumers
face dynamic tradeoffs over apartments rationed via lotteries and prices. We
show, theoretically and empirically, that changing rules complements increasing
supply. First, we present a motivating example in which supplying more housing
leads households to strategically delay their applications. By waiting for
&ldquo;better&rdquo; developments arriving tomorrow, households forgo mediocre developments
available today, resulting in more vacancies. Turning to the data from the
mechanism, we formulate a dynamic choice model over housing lotteries and
estimate it. Under the existing mechanism, we find that increasing supply fails
to lower wait times. However, when a strategyproof mechanism is implemented,
vacancies and wait times fall, but prices on the secondary market rise. Under
this new mechanism, building more apartments lowers wait times and reduces the
upward pricing pressure on the secondary market. </details></p>

<blockquote>
<p>How should the supply of public housing be optimally designed? Although
commonly used queuing mechanisms treat the supply of goods as exogenous,
designers often control the inflow of goods in practice. We study a dynamic
matching model where the designer minimizes a convex combination of mismatch and
vacancies, motivated by the Singaporean housing allocation process,
Build-To-Order. The optimal mechanism overproduces underdemanded housing
relative to the proportional benchmark, and competition over housing improves
match quality. Batching applications artificially generates competition and is
optimal when the planner places a high weight on match quality. Following our
dissemination of an early version of this paper, the Singaporean government
increased batching.</p>

<summary><b>Distributional effects of vehicle ownership restrictions</b>
<ul>

<li>Analysis (with microdata) in progress.</li>
</ul>
</summary>
<blockquote>
<p>We study vehicle population controls, their dynamic effects, alternative
policy designs, and implications for efficiency and equity. We leverage data
on the universe of vehicles in Singapore, the number of which is limited by
the Vehicle Quota Scheme (VQS). Under the VQS, car registrations must be
accompanied by permits allocated in fortnightly auctions; after ten years, car
permits expire and may be renewed at the prevailing auction price. First, we
observe that the effective tax on car ownership fluctuates by as much as
S$10,000 per year per car, possibly mispricing the negative externalities of
car ownership and use. To explain these large fluctuations in permit prices,
we present a theoretical example explaining herding in car replacement. When
permit prices fall unexpectedly, car owners renew their permits early, further
depressing prices. Turning to the data, we formulate a dynamic equilibrium
model of car ownership and replacement, which we calibrate to match trends in
permit prices and macroeconomic measures. This calibration informs our policy
recommendations in advance of analysis with government microdata.</p>
