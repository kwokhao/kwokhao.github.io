<p>We propose a quantitative spatial model featuring heterogeneous worker groups
and their travel to consume non-tradable goods and services. We consider the
opening of the Downtown Line (DTL) in Singapore, which connected regions where
high-income households have residential amenities to where non-traded sectors
are productive. Leveraging transit farecard data, we show that high-income
workers saw large welfare gains but low-income workers gained little. Everyone
enjoyed improved access to consumption opportunities, but low-income jobs in
non-tradables moved to less attractive workplaces. Abstracting from consumption
travel understates the disparate impact across worker groups three-fold.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>This paper investigates concerns that vertically integrated platforms like
Amazon steer demand towards their own offers via algorithmic prominence,
potentially harming consumers. On Amazon, for each product, the Buybox
prominence algorithm selects one seller to feature, influencing which offers
consumers consider. Using novel Amazon sales and Buybox (prominence)
data, we estimate a structural model capturing the effects of such algorithmic
prominence on consumer choices, seller pricing, and entry. We find that the
platform can indeed steer demand as 95% of consumers consider only the
Buybox offer. The Buybox is highly price-elastic (−21), but skews towards
Amazon’s own offers, which are featured as frequently as observably similar
offers priced 5% cheaper. Still, as consumers prefer these offers, this skew does
not amount to self-preferencing in the sense of harming consumers: consumer
surplus is roughly maximized at the estimated Amazon Buybox advantage,
which balances higher prices against showing consumers their preferred offers.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>We consider the design of a large-scale public housing program where consumers
face dynamic tradeoffs over apartments rationed via lotteries and prices. We
show, theoretically and empirically, that changing rules complements increasing
supply. First, we present a motivating example in which supplying more housing
leads households to strategically delay their applications. By waiting for
&ldquo;better&rdquo; developments arriving tomorrow, households forgo mediocre developments
available today, resulting in more vacancies. Turning to the data from the
mechanism, we formulate a dynamic choice model over housing lotteries and
estimate it. Under the existing mechanism, we find that increasing supply fails
to lower wait times. However, when a strategyproof mechanism is implemented,
vacancies and wait times fall, but prices on the secondary market rise. Under
this new mechanism, building more apartments lowers wait times and reduces the
upward pricing pressure on the secondary market. </details></p></blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>How should the supply of a good be optimally designed, when the designer can
determine the horizontal quality of the good? Although commonly used queuing
mechanisms treat the supply of goods as exogenous, in practice designers often
control the inflow of goods. We study a dynamic matching model where the
designer minimizes a convex combination of mismatch count and unassignment.
With endogenous supply, the optimal mechanism overproduces underdemanded goods
relative to the proportional benchmark, and competition improves match quality.
Batching applications artificially generates competition and is optimal when
the planner places a high weight on match quality. We apply our results to the
Singaporean housing allocation process, Build-To-Order. Following our
dissemination, the Singaporean government increased batching.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>We study vehicle population controls, their dynamic effects, alternative
policy designs, and implications for efficiency and equity. We leverage data on
the universe of vehicles in Singapore, the number of which is limited by the
Vehicle Quota Scheme (VQS). Under the VQS, car registrations must be accompanied
by permits allocated in fortnightly auctions; after ten years, car permits
expire and may be renewed at the prevailing auction price. First, we observe
that the effective tax on vehicle ownership fluctuates by as much as S$10,000
per year per vehicle, possibly mispricing the negative externalities of
ownership and use. To explain these large fluctuations in permit prices, we
formulate a dynamic equilibrium model of vehicle ownership and replacement by
individuals and firms. This model will be taken to administrative microdata to
evaluate welfare under the current and alternative designs.</p></blockquote>
