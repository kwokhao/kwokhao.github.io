<p>We propose a quantitative spatial model featuring heterogeneous worker groups
and their travel to consume non-tradable goods and services. We consider the
opening of the Downtown Line (DTL) in Singapore, which connected regions where
high-income households have residential amenities to where non-traded sectors
are productive. Leveraging transit farecard data, we show that high-income
workers saw large welfare gains but low-income workers gained little. Everyone
enjoyed improved access to consumption opportunities, but low-income jobs in
non-tradables moved to less attractive workplaces. Abstracting from consumption
travel understates the disparate impact across worker groups three-fold.</p></blockquote>

<p>This paper investigates concerns that vertically integrated platforms like
Amazon steer demand towards their own offers via algorithmic prominence,
potentially harming consumers. On Amazon, for each product, the Buybox
prominence algorithm selects one seller to feature, influencing which offers
consumers consider. Using novel Amazon sales and Buybox (prominence)
data, we estimate a structural model capturing the effects of such algorithmic
prominence on consumer choices, seller pricing, and entry. We find that the
platform can indeed steer demand as 95% of consumers consider only the
Buybox offer. The Buybox is highly price-elastic (−21), but skews towards
Amazon’s own offers, which are featured as frequently as observably similar
offers priced 5% cheaper. Still, as consumers prefer these offers, this skew does
not amount to self-preferencing in the sense of harming consumers: consumer
surplus is roughly maximized at the estimated Amazon Buybox advantage,
which balances higher prices against showing consumers their preferred offers.</p></blockquote>

<p>How should the supply of a good be optimally designed, when the designer can
determine the horizontal quality of the good? Although commonly used queuing
mechanisms treat the supply of goods as exogenous, in practice designers often
control the inflow of goods. We study a dynamic matching model where the
designer minimizes a convex combination of mismatch count and unassignment.
With endogenous supply, the optimal mechanism overproduces underdemanded goods
relative to the proportional benchmark, and competition improves match quality.
Batching applications artificially generates competition and is optimal when
the planner places a high weight on match quality. We apply our results to the
Singaporean housing allocation process, Build-To-Order. Following our
dissemination, the Singaporean government increased batching.</p></blockquote>

<p>We consider the design of a large-scale public housing program in Singapore
where consumers face dynamic tradeoffs over apartments rationed via lotteries
and prices. We show, theoretically and empirically, that batching allocations
improves welfare. First, we present a motivating example in which households
strategically delay their applications in favor of &ldquo;better&rdquo; projects arriving in
the future; batching allocations reduces wait times and unallocated apartments.
Turning to microdata from the mechanism, we formulate a dynamic choice model
over housing lotteries and estimate it. Welfare analysis and simulations of the
planner&rsquo;s problem, as well as outcomes under increased batching, are in
progress.</p></blockquote>

</summary>
<blockquote>
<p>Who gains and who loses when vehicle population controls are implemented? We
study the distributional effects and alternative designs of the Vehicle Quota
Scheme (VQS) in Singapore. Under the VQS, vehicle registrations must be
accompanied by Certificates of Entitlement (COEs) allocated through fortnightly
auctions; after ten years, COEs expire and may be renewed at the prevailing
auction price. We first observe that COE prices vary by as much as S$10,000 per
year per vehicle within the same vehicle class. While the VQS is part of a
broader policy toolkit to manage congestion, we argue that its primary function
today is revenue generation, with the potential for redistribution. To assess
the implications of large price fluctuations, we formulate a dynamic equilibrium
model of vehicle ownership and replacement and estimate it using administrative
microdata. Higher COE prices between 2009 to 2014 fell most heavily on residents
in the middle band of Singapore&rsquo;s urban geography, relative to those in the
downtown core or the outlying heartlands. Smoothing certificate supply over time
could raise welfare by up to 1% in net present value by dampening price
volatility. However, we find no evidence that shorter certificate durations
improve welfare: more frequent renewals imply that consumers incur higher
transaction costs than under the existing policy.</p></blockquote>
