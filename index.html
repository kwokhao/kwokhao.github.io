<p>I am an <strong>industrial organization</strong> economist working at the intersection of
<strong>digital markets</strong> and the <strong>smart city</strong>. I use administrative and
platform data to study how algorithms and policy rules govern search, matching,
pricing, and allocation, with a focus on transportation systems and public
housing.</p>
<p>I am an <strong><a href="https://discovery.nus.edu.sg/24637-kwok-hao-lee">Assistant
Professor</a></strong> (Presidential
Young Professor) at the Department of Strategy &amp; Policy at the <strong>National
University of Singapore (NUS) Business School</strong>. I am also a recipient of the
<strong><a href="https://www.ssrc.edu.sg/projects-awarded/research-fellowships/kwokhao2024/">Social Science and Humanities Research
Fellowship</a></strong>
under the Social Science Research Council of Singapore.</p>
<p>Previously, I was a Presidential Fellow at the NUS Business School, during which
I spent a postdoctoral stint at the Cowles Foundation at Yale University. I
obtained my PhD from Princeton University after formative years at the
University of Chicago and Washington University in St. Louis.</p>

<p>Benchmarks are important tools for tracking the rapid advancements in large
language model (LLM) capabilities. However, benchmarks are not keeping pace in
difficulty: LLMs now achieve more than 90% accuracy on popular benchmarks such
as Measuring Massive Multitask Language Understanding, limiting informed
measurement of state-of-the-art LLM capabilities. Here, in response, we
introduce Humanity’s Last Exam (HLE), a multi-modal benchmark at the frontier of
human knowledge, designed to be an expert-level closed-ended academic benchmark
with broad subject coverage. HLE consists of 2,500 questions across dozens of
subjects, including mathematics, humanities and the natural sciences. HLE is
developed globally by subject-matter experts and consists of multiple-choice and
short-answer questions suitable for automated grading. Each question has a known
solution that is unambiguous and easily verifiable but cannot be quickly
answered by internet retrieval. State-of-the-art LLMs demonstrate low accuracy
and calibration on HLE, highlighting a marked gap between current LLM
capabilities and the expert human frontier on closed-ended academic questions.
To inform research and policymaking upon a clear understanding of model
capabilities, we publicly release HLE at <a href="https://lastexam.ai">https://lastexam.ai</a>.</p>

<p>We propose a quantitative spatial model featuring heterogeneous worker groups
and their travel to consume non-tradable goods and services. We consider the
opening of the Downtown Line (DTL) in Singapore, which connected regions where
high-income households have residential amenities to where non-traded sectors
are productive. Leveraging transit farecard data, we show that high-income
workers saw large welfare gains but low-income workers gained little. Everyone
enjoyed improved access to consumption opportunities, but low-income jobs in
non-tradables moved to less attractive workplaces. Abstracting from consumption
travel understates the disparate impact across worker groups three-fold.</p>

<p>This paper investigates concerns that vertically integrated platforms like
Amazon steer demand towards their own offers via algorithmic prominence,
potentially harming consumers. On Amazon, for each product, the Buybox
prominence algorithm selects one seller to feature, influencing which offers
consumers consider. Using novel Amazon sales and Buybox (prominence)
data, we estimate a structural model capturing the effects of such algorithmic
prominence on consumer choices, seller pricing, and entry. We find that the
platform can indeed steer demand as 95% of consumers consider only the
Buybox offer. The Buybox is highly price-elastic (−21), but skews towards
Amazon’s own offers, which are featured as frequently as observably similar
offers priced 5% cheaper. Still, as consumers prefer these offers, this skew does
not amount to self-preferencing in the sense of harming consumers: consumer
surplus is roughly maximized at the estimated Amazon Buybox advantage,
which balances higher prices against showing consumers their preferred offers.</p>

<p>How should the supply of a good be optimally designed, when the designer can
determine the horizontal quality of the good? Although commonly used queuing
mechanisms treat the supply of goods as exogenous, in practice designers often
control the inflow of goods. We study a dynamic matching model where the
designer minimizes a convex combination of mismatch count and unassignment.
With endogenous supply, the optimal mechanism overproduces underdemanded goods
relative to the proportional benchmark, and competition improves match quality.
Batching applications artificially generates competition and is optimal when
the planner places a high weight on match quality. We apply our results to the
Singaporean housing allocation process, Build-To-Order. Following our
dissemination, the Singaporean government increased batching.</p>

</summary>
<blockquote>
<p>Who gains and who loses when vehicle population controls are implemented? We
study the distributional effects and alternative designs of the Vehicle Quota
Scheme (VQS) in Singapore, the receipts from which make up a substantial
fraction of city-state revenue. Under the VQS, vehicle registrations must be
accompanied by Certificates of Entitlement (COEs) allocated through fortnightly
auctions; after ten years, COEs expire and may be renewed at the prevailing
auction price. We first observe that COE prices vary by as much as S$10,000 per
year per vehicle within the same vehicle class. To assess the implications of
large price fluctuations, we formulate a dynamic equilibrium model of vehicle
ownership and replacement and estimate it using administrative microdata. Higher
COE prices between 2009 to 2014 fell most heavily on car owners in the middle
band of Singapore&rsquo;s urban geography, relative to those in the outlying
heartlands. Smoothing certificate supply over time could raise welfare by up to
0.85% in net present value by dampening price volatility. However, we find no
evidence that shorter certificate durations improve welfare: more frequent
renewals imply that consumers incur higher transaction costs than under the
existing policy.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We study short-run labor supply and search responses to transit disruptions
and their implications for market resilience. Using high-frequency GPS data on
Singapore taxi drivers and quasi-experimental variation from rail service
disruptions between 2016 and 2018, we document substantial reallocation of taxi
supply away from disrupted areas, decreasing trips and labor supply relative to
unaffected markets, possibly because of congestion. This effect is concentrated
among service delays during rush hour; taxi trips rise during service outages
and during off-peak periods. To assess welfare effects, we estimate a
continuous-time model of taxi demand and driver search. Using a novel impulse
response approach, we plan to evaluate how surge pricing and Uber-style matching
improves taxi supply in disrupted areas, complementing a long-run analysis.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In many dynamic allocation markets, forward-looking agents reject offers to wait
for better matches, creating inefficiency. We study this behavior in Singapore’s
Build-to-Order (BTO) housing program, where apartments are allocated to married
and engaged residents via a quarterly lottery and about 40% of offers are
rejected. Using administrative microdata, we estimate a structural model of
applicant behavior and simulate two policy interventions: deprioritizing
applicants who reject acceptable offers and batching allocations into less
frequent rounds. While banning rejections shortens queues, batching allocations,
i.e., moving from quarterly to annual lotteries, yields higher welfare by
improving match quality. Modest design changes can therefore meaningfully reduce
waste and enhance welfare, though the most intuitive fix may not achieve the
planner’s objectives.</p>
